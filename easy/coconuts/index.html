    <p>A number of sailors (let's call it N) are stranded on an island with a huge pile of coconuts and a monkey. During the night, each sailor (in turn) does the following without the others knowing:</p>
    <p>He takes one N'th (e.g. if N=5, one fifth) of the coconuts in the pile and hides them</p>
    <p>The division leaves one coconut left over, which is given to the monkey.</p>
    <p>In the morning, they split the remaining coconuts between them. This time the split is even. There's nothing left over for the monkey.</p>
    <p>Your task: Given the number of sailors (N), how many coconuts were in the pile to begin with (lowest possible number)?</p>
